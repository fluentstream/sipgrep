.SH DESCRIPTION

sipgrep strives to provide most of GNU grep's common features, applying
them to the SIP signaling protocol.  sipgrep is a pcap-aware tool that
will allow you to specify extended regular expressions to match against data
payloads of SIP packets with application specific filtering options.
The tool understands filter logic common to other packet sniffing tools,
such as
.BR tcpdump (8)
and
.BR sipgrep (1).


.SH OPTIONS
.IP -h
Display help/usage information.

.IP -V
Display version information.

.IP -e
Display empty packets.

.IP -i
Ignore case.

.IP -v
Invert match.

.IP -R
Do not try to drop privileges to the DROPPRIVS_USER.

sipgrep makes no effort to validate input from live or offline sources
as it is focused more on performance and handling large amounts of
data than protocol correctness, which is most often a fair assumption
to make.  However, sometimes it matters and thus as a rule sipgrep will
try to be defensive and drop any root privileges it might have.

There exist scenarios where this behaviour can become an obstacle, so
this option is provided to end-users who want to disable this feature,
but must do so with an understanding of the risks.  Packets can be
randomly malformed or even specifically designed to overflow sniffers
and take control of them, and revoking root privileges is currently
the only risk mitigation sipgrep employs against such an attack.  Use
this option and turn it off at your own risk.

.IP -w
Match the regex expression as a word.

.IP -p
Don't put the interface into promiscuous mode.

.IP -l
Make stdout line buffered.

.IP -D
When reading pcap_dump files, replay them at their recorded time
intervals (mimic realtime).

.IP -T
Print a timestamp in the form of +S.UUUUUU, indicating the delta
between packet matches.

.IP -m
Disable SIP Dialog matching.

.IP -M
Disable multi-line match (prefers single-line match instead).

.IP "-I pcap_dump"
Input file pcap_dump into sipgrep.  Works with any pcap-compatible dump
file format.  This option is useful for searching for a wide range of
different patterns over the same packet stream.

.IP "-O pcap_dump"
Output matched packets to a pcap-compatible dump file.  This feature
does not interfere with normal output to stdout.

.IP "-n num"
Match only
.I \fInum\fP
packets total, then exit.

.IP "-A num"
Dump \fInum\fP packets of trailing context after matching a packet.

.IP "-s snaplen"
Set the bpf caplen to snaplen (default 65536).

.IP "-S limitlen"
Set the upper limit on the size of packets that sipgrep will look at.
Useful for looking at only the first N bytes of packets without
changing the BPF snaplen.

.IP "-C"
Do not use colors in stdout.

.IP "-c"
Match user in Contact: SIP header.

.IP "-f"
Match user in From: SIP header.

.IP "-t"
Match user in To: SIP header.

.IP "-F file"
Read in the bpf filter from the specified filename.  This is a
compatibility option for users familiar with tcpdump.  Please note
that specifying ``-F'' will override any bpf filter specified on the
command-line.

.IP "-H ip:port"
Duplicate matching traffic to HEP Capture Server / HOMER.

.IP -N
Show sub-protocol number along with single-character identifier
(useful when observing raw or unknown protocols).

.IP -g
Disable clean-up of Dialogs during trace.

.IP -G
Print Dialogs report during trace.

.IP -J
Automatically send SIP packet-of-death to SipVicious scanners (kill).

.IP -j
For matching user-agent strings send SIP packet-of-death to
SipVicious scanners (kill).

.IP -q
Terminate sipgrep after a specified number of seconds.

.IP -a
Enable packet re-assemblation.

.IP -P
Specify SIP port range (default 5060-5061).

.IP "-d dev"
By default sipgrep will select a default interface to listen on.  Use
this option to force sipgrep to listen on interface \fIdev\fP.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS

Errors from
.B sipgrep, libpcap,
and the
.B GNU regex library
are all output to stderr.
